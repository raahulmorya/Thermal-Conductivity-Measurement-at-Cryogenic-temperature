## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to **measure thermal conductivity** of sample materials in the **cryogenic range (73K to 123K)** by recording temperature gradients across the material and power supplied to a heater. The entire setup is built using **ESP32**, **MAX31865 (RTD amplifier)**, **INA219 (current & voltage sensing)**, and logs data to **Google Sheets** with real-time monitoring via an **embedded web dashboard**.

## 📊 Thermal Conductivity Formula

\[
k = \frac{Q \cdot L}{A \cdot \Delta T}
\]

Where:  
- \( k \) = Thermal conductivity (W/m·K)  
- \( Q \) = Power supplied to heater (W)  
- \( L \) = Length of the sample (m)  
- \( A \) = Cross-sectional area of the sample (m²)  
- \( \Delta T \) = Temperature difference across the sample (K)
